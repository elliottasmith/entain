As you know, my brother works in the PriceKinetics team as a Go developer. I asked if he had any recommendations for testing frameworks for Go, like NUnit for .Net and he recommended just using the built in go testing library and using the stretchr/testify library for the assert package which saves writing a lot of boilerplate code in every test and using the mocks package along with vektra/mockery for generating mocks. You can run all the tests in each service by running go test ./... in the respective service directories. I decided that mocking the actual SQL db layer was probably outside of the scope of this exercise.
